## Outlook on the Desktop

### Description
Outlook on the Desktop (aka OotD) is a Windows application written in C# which places a fully functional calendar (or other Outlook component) directly on your desktop so that it's always in your view and makes you much more likely to use it.

### Build Requirements:

* To open and build the OutlookDesktop.sln, you'll need to clone my forked [NetSparkle repo] (https://github.com/mscrivo/NetSparkle) along side where you cloned the OotD repo, as it's referenced in the solution.
